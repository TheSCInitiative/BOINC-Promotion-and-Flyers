# BOINC Promotion and Flyers

This repository is built to track and store materials which can be used to promote BOINC and the many projects which use it. If you have any materials to add, you can submit a pull request or contact contact{at}thesciencecommons.org.

Copies of some of our promotional materials are available in sticker form at our [redbubble store](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/152119682)

High-res versions of the logo are available at the [BOINC logo page](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/logo.php)
